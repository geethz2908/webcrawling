This Go-based client-server application facilitates web crawling. The server listens on port 8080 for connections, handles URL requests by extracting hyperlinks from the provided web pages, and sends these links back to the client. The client connects to the server, submits a URL, and prints the list of hyperlinks received in response. This setup demonstrates basic network communication, HTTP request handling, and HTML parsing using Go.
